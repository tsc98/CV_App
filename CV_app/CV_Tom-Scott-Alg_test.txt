Built consensus, momentum and business across the 4 commands and 3 supporting agencies. Established and chaired a pan-defence organisation, across 12 organisations, focussed on the coherence and progression of autonomous system policy and governance. Through engagement upto C-suite level, secured the organisations position as the Army’s autonomous system R&D delivery partner, resulting a commitment of £6.5m of funding for 4 years. Identified and formalised a clear route from R&D to capability delivery, expected to significantly reduce the acquisition cycle time.NHS Operations Planner, Frimley Park Foundation Trust. Mar 2020 – Jul 2020Formed, established and led a planning team, working directly for the Trust COO to reorganise the Trust’s response to COVID-19.Achievements:•	Rapidly orientated and identified the key challenges facing the Trust.
